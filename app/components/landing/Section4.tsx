            Hi, I’m Loise, the dreamer behind kena. In 2021, I moved to a new
            country, full of hope for an exciting adventure. Instead, I found
            myself navigating unfamiliar cultural differences and long work
            hours in a place far from home, where I knew no one. By 2023, my
            spark was dimming - help was seriously needed so I opted for therapy
            as a sounding board and started listening to podcasts on wellness.
            These two introduced me to key tools like the wheel of feelings,
            emotional forecasting, journaling - sketches, scribbled notes and
            coloring helped me visualise my emotions and taught me to see them
            as guides. My journey from chaos to clarity, lit the spark for kena:
            an app to help you and I visualize and take the journey from where
            you are to where you want to be. It’s just an idea, and I’d love
            your perspective to bring it to life. C’mon join me—take our quick
